# ðŸ•µâ™‚ KYC, Audit and SAFU

* _KYC (Know Your Customer), auditing, and the SAFU (Secure Asset Fund for Users) seal are important security measures in cryptocurrency projects. KYC is a legal requirement for companies dealing with cryptocurrencies and aims to verify the identity of their users, preventing fraud and money laundering._
* _Auditing is an independent and impartial evaluation process of a company's procedures, including its finances and internal controls. In cryptocurrency projects, an audit helps verify the accuracy of the information provided by the company and ensure that user funds are safe._
* _Finally, the SAFU seal is an additional security measure that ensures that user funds are protected in the event of hacking or other vulnerabilities. It ensures that the company has a security fund in case of asset loss, providing an extra layer of protection for users._
